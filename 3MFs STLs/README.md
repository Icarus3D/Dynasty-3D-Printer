# .3MF & .STL Files
All files are available in .3MF and .STL format.
Files with the prefix "a_" are printed with the secondary color. Blue is the secondary color of the reference model.
Some files that need to be printed several times have the number of units to be printed as a suffix, for example "_x2".
It is recommended to print the parts used inside the enclosure in ABS or any other equivalent plastic. Other parts that are not sensitive to temperature can be printed in PLA or PETG.
Grommets are the exception. They are printed in TPU A95 to be flexible enough to let the cables pass through.

This printer uses parts made by other designers. Here is a list of these pieces with the details of their remix.
All these files keep their original license.

## DIN Rail Bracket
* a_DIN_Rail_Bracket_Clip_08_Dynasty_Remix_x6.stl<br />
This is a small remix of the [LM2596 Buck Converter Din Bracket](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4820100) originally created by 100k3y.
The original was not tight enough on the rail and the brackets were moving along the DIN rail when the printer was moved. To correct this, the distance between the two brackets was reduced by 0.8mm.

## Exhaust Fan Case
* a_fancase-server-bottom-fan-housing.stl
* a_fancase-server-grille.stl
* fancase-server-filter-section.stl<br />
The exhaust fan case [3D Enclosure Extractor Fan with HEPA Carbon filters v2](https://www.printables.com/fr/model/54864-3d-enclosure-extractor-fan-with-hepa-carbon-filter) was made by Colin.
I did not change anything in the original files. I modeled two printed seals in TPU to have a better airtightness.

## Spool Holder
* a_FillerGuideSource_Dynasty_Remix.stl
* a_FillerRollerSource_Dynasty_Remix.stl
* a_FillerWallMountSource_Dynasty_Remix.stl<br />
Remix from the [Filler - The Customizable Filament Holder that fills your printer!](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3020026) originally created by HugoHuge.
The roller and the guide has been enlarged to fit a 2.3kg filament spool.
The wall mount has also been modified so that it can be attached to the aluminum profile and panel without touching the other components.

## Door latch
* a_Enclosure_Latch_Left_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl
* a_Enclosure_Lever_Left_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl
* Enclosure_Lock_Body_Left_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl
* a_Enclosure_Latch_Right_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl
* a_Enclosure_Lever_Right_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl
* Enclosure_Lock_Body_Right_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl<br />
This latch originally come from VoronDesign. Unfornately, I have never found the orginals files of VoronDesign. I got them from the VzBot .step files by Vez3D.
The side in contact with the plexiglass door has been enlarged to ensure better adhesion. The shape has been slightly modified to match the size of Motedis aluminum profiles.

## Panel Clip
* Midspan_Panel_Clip_3mm_Dynasty_Remix_x28.stl
* Midspan_Panel_Clip_4mm_Dynasty_Remix_x10.stl<br />
Originals files [midspan_panel_clip_3mm_x12.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-1/blob/Voron1.8/STLs/Panel_Mounting/midspan_panel_clip_3mm_x12.stl) were made by VoronDesign.
The 3mm version has been slightly modified to have a tighter fit and does not touch the 3D printed panels of the electronic bay.
The 4mm version is based on the 3mm and used for the 4mm electronic panel. The dimensions have been adapted for the 4mm panel and prevent the clip from touching the 3D printed panels.

## Handle
* VzBoT_Handle_Dynasty_Remix_x2.stl<br />
Remix of VzBot handle [handle.stl](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Frame/STLs/handle.stl) originally created by Vez3D.
The handles have been raised a few millimeters to facilitate access to the handles near the panels.

## Hotend
* a_shroud_dynasty_remix.stl
* top_orbiter_mgn12_dynasty_remix.stl
* etc...<br />
All the files of the 3D carriage platform of this printer were created by the [EVA](https://main.eva-3d.page/) team.
A grid has been added to the shroud to protect the fan. The edges have been shortened to allow the addition of an ADXL345 accelerometer. 
Two holes were added to the top orbiter mgn12 to put two M2.5 inserts wich allow to fix the accelerometer.

## Wires Holder
* Frame_Wires_Holder.stl<br />
This [Frame Wires Holder](https://www.blvprojects.com/post/beta-test-frame-wires-holder) were made by Ben Levi.
They have not been modified.
